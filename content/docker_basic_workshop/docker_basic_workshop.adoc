== What are we looking for?

* Scalability, maintainability, Agility, Portability.
* Improved resource utilization.
* A continuum of abstraction levels.

== Linux containers

* Using Linux kernel process isolation and resource features to give a VM
like environment.

* Docker project is around two years old, but linux containers are older than that e.g. LXC.

* Some examples of linux container runtime: LXC, lmctfy, Docker, Rkt

== Introducing Docker

* Sand boxing of process/Application

* It is an application packaging and delivery mechanism.

* Lightweight container virtualization platform.

== Why Developers Care?

* Build once -> run anywhere*
* A clean, safe, hygenic and portable runtime environment.
* No worries about missing dependencies, packages etc.
* Automate testing, integration, packaging -> anything you can script.
* It is portable* -> so it reduces the concern about portability.

== Why Operations Care?

* It reduces the time , from developing an application to putting it in to production
* The entire lifecycle can made more efficient, consistent and repeatable.
* Reduce the inconsistencies between development, test, production and customer environment.
* Because the containers are so lightweight, address significant performance, costs, deployment  and portability issues.

== Docker Vs Virtual Machine

* Lighter than Virtual machines.
* Less startup time
* We can run a lot of containers on a reasonably sized host.
* Deploying and scaling relatively easy.

== Kernel Features which enables containrization

* Control Groups
* Namespaces
* Union filesystem
* Kernel Security features

=== Namespace

* It helps to create isolated workspace for each process.
* When you run a container, Docker creates a set of namespaces for that container.


=== Cgroup

* Control Groups are another key component of Linux Containers
* With Cgroup we can implement resource accounting and limiting.
* Ensure that each container gets its fair share of memory, CPU, disk I/O.
* Thanks to Cgroup, we can make sure that single container cannot bring the system down by exhausting resources.

=== Kernel Security features

* Capabilities
** By default Docker drops all capabilities except those needed.
** "root" within a container has much less privileges than the real "root".
** The best practice for users would be to remove all capabilities except those explicitly required for their processes.
** Even if an intruder manages to escalate to root within a container, it will be much harder to do serious damage, or to escalate to the host

* Other kernel security features: TOMOYO, AppArmor, SELinux, GRSEC, etc.

=== SELinux

* SELinux provides secure separation of containers by applying SELinux policy and labels. 

== Docker Components

* *Image* : It is a template which is used to launch containers. 

* *Container* : Container holds everything that is needed for an application to run.

* *Registry* : It stores and serves up the actual image assets, and it delegates authentication to the index.

* *Index* : It is the front end of Registry. It manages user accounts, permissions, search, tagging, and all that nice stuff thatâ€™s in the public web interface

== Installing Docker

Fedora
^^^^^^

[source, bash]
-----------------
$ sudo yum -y install docker
$ sudo systemctl start docker
$ sudo systemctl enable docker
