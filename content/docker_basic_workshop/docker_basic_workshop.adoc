== What are we looking for?

* Scalability, maintainability, Agility, Portability.
* Improved resource utilization.
* A continuum of abstraction levels.

== Linux containers

* Using Linux kernel process isolation and resource features to give a VM
like environment.

* Docker project is around two years old, but linux containers are older than that e.g. LXC.

* Some examples of linux container runtime: LXC, lmctfy, Docker, Rkt

== Introducing Docker

* Sand boxing of process/Application

* It is an application packaging and delivery mechanism.

* Lightweight container virtualization platform.

== Why Docker?

* Build once -> run anywhere*
